# Snake-Game
A small project made as an exercise during the 100 Days of Python Bootcamp

Much like the game included on early cell phones, the user manipulates the snake with the arrow keys
and attempts to collect 'food' in order to grow the snake. 

Colliding with the walls or colliding with the snake body will cause a game over an reset the score.
